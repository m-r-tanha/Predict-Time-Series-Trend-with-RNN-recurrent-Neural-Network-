    Challenge:
</p2>



<p4>
    We donâ€™t know whether a feature or parameter setting which is implemented in network is useful or harmful.
Solution: With Using the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)  method the KPI trend can be predicted to see the impact.
The following figure shows the result of a deep learning system on KPI and it illustrates if this setting was not implemented, the trend was the orange trend, and with this setting the actual KPI is blue one. </p4>

All activation functions and optimizers have been implemented and finally the "Tanh" and "Adagrad" have the best performance
