# Challange
<p4>
   We donâ€™t know whether a feature or parameter which is implemented in the network is useful or harmful. 
    
 # Solution   
 By using the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) technique the KPI trend can be predicted to see its impact.  </p4>

 # Result  
 The code has been implemeneted for different "Activation Function", "Optimizer", and "Loss Function" to see which combination has the best result for a specific time series data. this time consuming analysis should be done for each trend. </p4>

All activation functions and optimizers have been implemented and finally the "Tanh" and "Adagrad" have the best performance
